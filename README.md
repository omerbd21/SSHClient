# SSH Client
My first gin (golang) project, combined with a very basic ReactJS UI.
## What does it do?
It allows to connect to a remote linux server, run commands and get the input on the browser.
## Notes
You'll have to consider that this is a very minimal project and therefore it won't have the best of performance or the greatest UI.
Things to add:
1. The ability to run multipule commands on a row, or a script
2. A sustainable prompt (the abilty to run multipule commands without having to reconnect every command)
3. A way better UI (a dashboard, a terminal look-alike)
4. The ability to save a host for later sessions (and therefore, users and authentication)
